# GTFS-Accessibility
This project uses the network shape and locations of a GTFS dataset to calculate distances to common used facilities over roadnetwork and public transport network. The toolset used in this project is still in an experimental phase. Many of to codebase should be optimized for different systems, some code should still be generalized to functions.
